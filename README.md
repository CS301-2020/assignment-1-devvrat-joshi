# Assignment1
An example Makefile is provided. Modify it to compile your shell. Dummy files shell.c and ls.c are given here. The main shell binary must be named "shell". Modify ls.c or delete it if not required and put all other files that are there.

## All the custom commands are made as .c files and then compiled to binaries
## Just run the make command and the shell will run
### Has some extra functionality:
#### If you make your new custom command, then just name the binary of that command as custom{{command}} and you need not to edit anything in the shell.c file
## Verified to run on:
#### Checked on Windows Subsystem for Linux , distro : Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
#### Checked on virtual box, OS : Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
